- **Maintainable**: AutoMapper, Entity Framework, and Autofac keep the system modular and maintainable.
- **Security**: Identity Framework, SSLCommerz, and structured logging with Serilog ensure secure user and transaction handling.
- **Professional UI/UX**: AdminLTE and DataTables provide a seamless, professional user experience.
- **Testing-First Mindset**: NUnit and Moq ensure high code quality and minimum production bugs.

## 🏛️ Architecture & Design Patterns

Our project is structured with a strong focus on scalability, maintainability, and best practices. Below are the key architecture and design patterns we have implemented:

| **Concept/Pattern** | **Description** |
| :-------------------| :---------------|
| **Clean Architecture** | We structured the solution based on Clean Architecture principles to keep business logic independent from frameworks and external technologies. It improves maintainability, testability, and scalability. |
| **Repository Pattern** | Applied to abstract data access logic and provide a flexible architecture that isolates database operations from the business layer. |
| **Unit of Work** | Ensures that multiple repository operations are coordinated and committed together, providing better transaction management and reducing redundant database calls. |
| **SOLID Principles** | The entire project strictly follows SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) to create robust, loosely-coupled, and easily extendable code. |
| **Factory Pattern** | Used for creating instances where object creation is complex or requires control, promoting loose coupling and better management of object lifecycle. |
| **GitFlow** | A Git branching strategy that defines strict roles for branches and organizes releases, hotfixes, and feature development, improving collaboration and deployment processes. |

---

✅ **Result:**  
Using these design patterns ensures that our application is **highly maintainable**, **scalable**, **testable**, and **future-proof** for upcoming features and changes.
